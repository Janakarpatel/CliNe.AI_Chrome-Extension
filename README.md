Chrome Extension

![CliNe Logo](ui-ux_design/style_guide/banner_chrome.png)

CliNe is a Chrome extension and API that helps users identify clickbait news titles while browsing news websites. It utilizes natural language processing techniques to analyze news titles and provide real-time feedback on their clickbait nature.

## Project Overview
This project aims to combat the spread of clickbait news by providing users with a tool to identify potentially misleading titles. It consists of the following components:

- **Machine Learning**: The machine learning part involves training a deep learning model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) architecture. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of clickbait and non-clickbait news titles, and it learns to recognize patterns and features that distinguish between the two categories.

By leveraging the power of machine learning, the CliNe project provides users with an effective tool to identify and avoid clickbait news titles, promoting more informed and reliable browsing experiences.

- **Chrome Extension**: A browser extension that integrates with Google Chrome and provides real-time clickbait detection while browsing news websites.

- **API**: A Python-based API that powers the clickbait detection functionality of the Chrome extension. It uses machine learning models to analyze news titles and classify them as clickbait or non-clickbait.

## Key Features
- Real-time clickbait detection while browsing news websites.
- Pop-up alerts for identified clickbait titles.
- Ability to report false positives or false negatives for continuous improvement.
- Local deployment of the API for users who want to run it on their own devices.
